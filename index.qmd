# Welcome to linear algebra

## Contents of this submodule

This part of the module will deal with numerical algorithms that involve
matrices. The study of this type of problem is called *linear algebra*. We will
approach these problems using a mix of theoretical ideas thinking through the
lens of practical solutions. This means that you will do some programming (using
Python) and some pen and paper theoretical work too.

### Topics

We will have 7 double-lectures, 3/4 tutorials and 3/4 labs. We break up the
topics as follows:

Lectures

1. Introduction and motivation, key problem statements
2. When can we solve systems of linear equations?
3. Direct methods for systems of linear equations
4. Iterative solution of linear equations
5. Complex numbers
6. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
7. Practical solutions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors / Summary

Labs

1. Floating point numbers
2. When can we solve systems of linear equations?
3. Systems of linear equations
4. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Tutorials

1. Direct methods for systems of linear equations
2. Indirect methods for systems of linear equations
3. Complex numbers
4. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

## Learning outcomes

Candidates should be able to:

- explain practical challenges working with floating point numbers;
- define and identify what is means for a set of vectors to be a basis, spanning
  set or linear independent;
- apply direct and iterative solvers to solve systems of linear equations;
  implement methods using floating point numbers and investigate computational
  cost using computer experiments;
- apply algorithms to compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues of large matrices.
