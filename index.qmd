title: Welcome to Linear Algebra

## Contents of this submodule

This part of the module will deal with numerical algorithms that involve matrices. The study of this type of problem is called *linear algebra*. We will approach these problems using a mix of theoretical ideas thinking through the lens of practical solutions. This means that you will do some programming (usin gPython) and some pen and paper theoretical work too.

### Topics

We will have 7 double-lectures, 3/4 tutorials and 3/4 labs. We break up the topics as follows:

Lectures

1. Introduction and motivation, key problem statements
2. When can we solve systems of linear equations?
3. Direct methods for systems of linear equations
4. Iterative solution of linear equations
5. Complex numbers
6. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
7. Practical solutions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors / Summary
